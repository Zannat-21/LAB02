# VIVAQUESTION 2
```
2. Write a program that includes a method to determine if a given string is a palindrome. A 
palindrome is a word, phrase, number, or other sequence of characters that reads the same 
backward or forward (ignoring spaces, punctuation, and capitalization). 
Implement a method called `removeSpecialCharacters` that takes a string as input and 
removes all special characters (e.g., punctuation marks) from it. Use this method within the 
`isPalindrome` method before checking if the input is a palindrome. 
The method, isPalindrome , should take a string as input and return a boolean indicating 
whether it is a palindrome or not. 
Case 1: 
Original String: “1221”
Reversed String: “1221”
Therefore, the program should return true. 
Case 2: 
Original String: “Able was I ere I saw Elba” 
Reversed String: “ablewasiereisawelba” 
Therefore, the program should return true. 
Case 3: 
Original String = "Able was I, ere I saw Elba!"; 
Reversed String = "ablewasiereisawelba" 
Therefore, the program should return true. 
Instruction: 
1. Prompt the user to enter a sentence. 
2. Check if the input is a palindrome. 
3. Provide the user with an appropriate message indicating whether their input is a 
palindrome or not.
